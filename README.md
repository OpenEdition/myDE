# My Digital Environment

## Introduction

**My Digital Environment** is a Symfony Bundle provided by OpenEdition, allowing the quick setup of a virtual workplace
that can then be further extended and personalized in a project or with other Bundles.

This Bundle is developed as part of the COMMONS project (https://www.cnrs.fr/en/node/6271) supported by the CNRS and
three leading French infrastructures in the humanities and social sciences: OpenEdition, Huma-Num, and Métopes. It aims
to cover the entire knowledge production chain, from data creation to its dissemination in the public sphere.
